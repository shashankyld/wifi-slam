C++ - 6
CUDA LAB - 9
MSR LAB - 12
Paralel - 9
CR - 6
Advanced ML - 3

DL4VR - 6 (only if the exercises are 90% same as from that guy from git, and if we dont have to attend lectures)


===================================================


Maybe:
DL for VR - 6 (WE WILL SEE FOR COMBO)
TNN - 6 (90% NOTHING)
NLP - 6 (NOT IN THIS LIFE)
Paralel Computing LAB - 9
Advanced ML - 3 (EASY FOR COMBO)
Marija course - 3 (probably wont be teached)
Cognittive robotics - 6 (MAYBE???)
Self driving - ourselfs if you are interested


Combos (we need 9):
1) DL4VR + CR = 12
2) NLP + AML = 9
3) PARALEL + DL4VR = 15
4)

Paralel Computing + Cognitive robotics = 15
Dangerrrrr: Fail Cognitive Robotics - thats okay still 9 points on paralel comp
Fail paralel comp - PROBLEM PROBLEM (we need 3 points)

parallel + CR + DL4VR
